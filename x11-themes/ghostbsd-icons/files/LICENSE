:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Vivacious Colors Icon Theme :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Vivacious Colors is a NEW modern, clean and bold GTK icon theme. Featuring an "vivid" and completely NEW set of application icons. And amazing folders and indicators. All icons in vivacious are flat and modern but use gradients and shading for more detail and sophistication. Vivacious uses a fusion of components from many great open source icon projects. But we add to and develop many new aspects of our own on top of this Including taking on new App icon development & re-design and other aspects as needed. Vivacious features 4 refined folder colors by default. and 10 more installable via the folder-colors package.

Vivacious Colors is based on our tried and true Vibrancy Colors icon theme framework (Folders, Indicators, Actions etc). However we have completely replaced the rounded App icons with a newly re-designed (With some parts built from scratch) Set of vivid and beautiful application icons that come in multiple shapes and are fully SVG.

Vivacious uses Plasma Next icons as a base for our app icons. However we have overhauled the look of nearly everything (to match our design vision) We have also created lots of new icons and redesigned many aspects. The theme has also been built out so nearly all common apps and even uncommon ones "theme" with our theme! A huge thanks to the Emerald Icon theme and Vince Luice for his hard work making Plasma Next Icons more GTK friendly. Vivacious is based on Emerald and Plasma but we look different as we have gone in a different direction.
